I used Python 2.7.13 because I started this experiences with the Python API for Trello that seems to work well with thats version.
RVU 0.0.12 has been tested with Python 2.7.15.
The documentation of Python 2.7 is here:
	https://docs.python.org/2.7/

I want use Git as version control system.

I use:
	Python library for interacting with the Trello API: 
		https://pypi.org/project/trello/0.9.3/
	This Python API is a wrapper around the Trello API.
	You can find documentation for the Python API at:
		https://pythonhosted.org/trello/
	See this README:
		https://github.com/tghw/trello-py/blob/master/README.md
	
	
1) The first thing to do is to get your Trello Application Key.
This Key identifies your Application to the API and is needed for any authenticated or unauthenticated API Calls.
Go here to get your Trello Application Key:
	https://trello.com/app-key
It is a 32 digits hex string.
You will use it as a character string between ''.

2) If we want to access private boards, we'll have to have a user's token. A 64-digit hex string.
We can get a user's token by calling:
	trello.get_token_url('My App', expires='30days', write_access=True)
the result is a URL:
	'https://trello.com/1/authorize?key=TRELLO_APP_KEY&name=My+App&expiration=30days&response_type=token&scope=read,write'
If you send your user to the resulting URL, it will ask them to allow your app access to their account,
and then it will give them a token (64-digit hex string) that they will pass back to your app.

3) To revoke your tokens go here:
    https://trello.com/<trello user>/account
	
4) I use cx_freeze to generate an executable version on snakello, for Win64bit. Use the module cxfreeze_setup.py and execute this:
		python .\cxfreeze_setup.py build
	Than, copy \build\exe.win…\libs\* under …\build\exe.win…\
